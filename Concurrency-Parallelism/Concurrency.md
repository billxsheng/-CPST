# Concurrency

> Consider you are given a task of singing and eating at the same time:
- At a given instance, you are either singing or eating
- You would repeat each until your food is finished or the song is over
- You are performing your tasks concurrently

**Concurrency means you are executing multiple tasks at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously. For example, in a concurrent app, two tasks can start, and complete in overlapping time periods instead of one at a time.**
