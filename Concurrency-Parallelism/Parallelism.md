# Parallelism

> Consider you are given two tasks of cooking and speaking on the phone

- These tasks can be done at the same time. You don't need to stop cooking to speak on the phone. You are doing these tasks "in parallel".

**Parallelism means performing two or more tasks simultaneously.**

## How is concurrency related to parallelism?
- Both focus on how tasks/computations are performed
- In a single core environment -> concurrency created through context switching
- in a multi-core environment -> concurrency created through parallelism  

> Both concurrency and parallelism deal with the way tasks are executed.
