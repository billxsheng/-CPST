## How to approach a systems design interview question

1. Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions
    - Gather requirements and scope the problem, ask questions clarifying use cases and constraints, discuss assumptions
    - Who is going to use it? How many users are there? Inputs and Outputs?
2. Create a high level design
    - sketch components
    - justify ideas
3. Design core components
    - details
4. Scale the design
    - Identify and address bottlenecks
