# Application Layer
## Microservices
- A suite of independently deployable, small, modular services
- Each service runs a unique process and communicates to serve a business goal

### Disadvantages
- Adding an application layer with loosely coupled services requires a different approach from a monolithic system (single, indivisible components)
